[OptionExplanations]
ReceptorSize = Scale the size of the receptors and notes. This will also indirectly scale your scrolling speed.
JudgeType = Set Judgecount Type.
JudgmentText = Show or hide text associated with judgments.
TargetTracker = Enable AA Tracker. Displays the differential between your current score and 93% of the maximum score obtainable. Enabling it should result in no more than a 0.1% fps drop.
JudgeCounter = Enable Judge Counter. Displays your currently obtained judgment counts. This has a moderate impact on performance. Expect about a 10% penalty to average fps.
ErrorBar = Enable Error Bar. Visual representation of your judgments' deviation from the intended mark. This is about as taxing as the judge counter performance-wise, though more useful. 
ErrorBarLoc = Set the positioning of the error bar to center or bottom. 
PlayerInfo = Enable the player info display in the bottom left. This is the most taxing gameplay screen element. Expect a 20% or higher drop in average fps. It's also useless for non-streamers. Advised to disable.
FullProgressBar = Displays your progress through the song as well as song title.
MiniProgressBar = Display a smaller, less intrusive, more accessible version of the progress bar placed above the combo text. 

AvgScoreType = Set Scoretype for average score
GhostScoreType= Set Scoretype of ghost score
GhostTarget= Set target for ghost score
PaceMaker=Enable Pacemaker Graph. The target graph will be the same as your ghostscoretype/target settings.
LaneCover=Enable lane cover which will cover a portion of the notefield. The height can be adjusted by holding down <Select>+<EffectUp/Down>
CBHighlight=Highlights the lane where a combo breaking judgment has occured.

SongBGEnabled = Toggle whether to show the song's background image or not on the select and the eval screen.
EvalBGType = Set the type of background to show for ScreenEvaluation.
SongBGMouseEnabled = Toggle whether to enable the moving of the background image with the mouse.

Particles = Toggle whether to show particles or not for certain screens.
RateSort = If enabled, the scores will be sorted for different rate mod that was used.
HelpMenu = Toggle whether to automatically display the help menu after a certain period of time has passed.
NPSWindow = Sets the time window (in seconds) of the NPS Display. Smaller window quickly adapts to sudden changes while a larger window gives more stable values.

ReceptorSize=Sets the size of the receptors.
MeasureLines=Toggle whether to display measure lines on the notefield. Please reload metrics afterwards.
ProgressBar = Determines the location of the progress bar during gameplay.
